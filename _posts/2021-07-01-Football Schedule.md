# Summary:
With the NFL set to remove capacity limitations for all 2021-2022 games, how quickly could someone attend enough games to see all 32 teams play live and in-person? Using the Pyomo package in Python, we will try to determine the optimal schedule to achieve such a feat.

# Defining the Model:
There are 272 games scheduled for the upcoming season across 18 weeks, and while most of the games are played on Sundays, Monday and Thursday night games offer even more opportunities so shorten the amount of time needed to watch every team. With so many possible choices potential games to attend 

## Objective: 
Find the earliest date in which someone could have seen all 32 teams play in-person.
