# Summary:
Turnstile data taken from Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the purposes of exploratory analysis and forecasting.

# Retrieving and Cleaning the Data
All data for this project can be found [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) or on my github page LINK NEEDED. 

Each week the Metropolitan Transportation Authority posts a txt file with the daily number of entries and exits from all New York subway stations. My goal in this analysis is to focus on only the data from Penn Station. 

# Visualizing the Data
