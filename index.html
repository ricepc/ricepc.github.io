I am a full-time Jr. Data Analyst, currently on track to complete my Masters degree in Decision Analystic through Virginia Commonwealth University's DAPT Program. 

Based in Richmond, I enjoy using data to tell compelling stories and to create robust, user friendly solutions to current business oppurtunities.
