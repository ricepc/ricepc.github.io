I am a full-time Jr. Data Analyst, currently on track to complete my Masters degree in Decision Analystic through Virginia Commonwealth University's DAPT Program. Based in Richmond, I enjoy applying data to tell compelling stories and to create robust, user friendly solutions to current business oppurtunities. 

Ever since college, it has been my philosphy that you can't celebrate a birthday without a cake and therefore spend my free time baking for friends and family.
